Exception: 
		It is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an object that is thrown at the runtime.

Exception Handling:
	This mechanism is used to handle the run time errors (like ClassNotFoundException, SQLException, IOException, RemoteException) and maintain the normal flow of the application or execution.

* java.lang.Throwable class is the root of Java Exception hierarchy inherited by two subclasses: Exception and Error.

Types:
1. Checked Exception:
	- Checked Exceptions are checked at Compile - time.
	- The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.
	- IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException.

2. Unchecked Exception:
	- Unchecked Exceptions are not checked at compile - time, but they are checked at Run Time.
	- The classes that inherit the RunTimeException are known as Unchecked Exceptions.
	- ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, StirngIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NumberFormatException.

3. Error:
	- Error is irrecoverable.
	- OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError


Keywords:

1. Try : specifies a block where an exception code has to be placed. This can't be placed alone, It should follow by either catch or Finally.

2. Catch : The "catch" block is used to handle the exception.

3. Finaly : This block executes the necessary code of the program.

4. throw : Throws an exception.

5. throws : This declares the exception. This specifies that there may occur an exception in a method. It is used with the Method Signature.
