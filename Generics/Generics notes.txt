Java Generics:
- Generics are used to store a specific type of objects.
- This is used to deal with type- safe objects.
- By using this, The code is made stable by detecting the bugs at compile time itself.


Advantages:
1. Type - Safety
2. Type casting is Not required
3. Checking during Compile-time
